# Overview
The project is broken down into two parts, the frontend and the backend. The frontend contains all the usual stuffs. Its build with vite. The backend handles mainly the authentication. Nothing much to say.

# Start
Frontend: Go to the root directory and type npm run dev. This would start up the clientside.
Backend: Go to the root directory and type nodemon app.ts. This would spinup that badboy.

# What I loved about the Project:
Everything. Really enjoyed it.
